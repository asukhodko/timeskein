# Current Implementation

## Status

Last updated: 2026-06-30.

This document describes what the repository actually runs today. Target architecture and future plans remain in RFCs and roadmap documents.

## Runtime Baseline

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 11+
- Rust latest stable
- macOS is the only native desktop target currently verified

The root package declares `packageManager: pnpm@11.7.0` and requires Node 24 / pnpm 11.

## Working Modes

### Browser Development Mode

Browser mode is for UI development. It uses the mock server and does not persist data to SQLite.

```bash
CI=true pnpm install
pnpm --filter @timeskein/contracts build
pnpm mock-server
pnpm --filter @timeskein/desktop dev:frontend
```

- UI: `http://localhost:5173`
- Mock API: `http://127.0.0.1:3456/api`

### macOS Desktop App

The macOS Tauri app embeds the Rust agent in the same process.

```bash
pnpm --filter @timeskein/desktop dev
```

For release-style local build:

```bash
pnpm --filter @timeskein/desktop build
```

Build output:

```text
target/release/bundle/macos/Timeskein.app
```

## Agent Integration

The Rust agent is still a separate crate (`apps/agent`), but the macOS desktop shell starts it as an embedded runtime.

Startup flow:

1. Tauri setup starts the embedded agent.
2. The agent opens SQLite in the user data directory.
3. The agent binds `127.0.0.1:0`, so the OS chooses a free local port.
4. The agent writes the selected port to `agent.port`.
5. The frontend calls the Tauri command `get_api_url`.
6. The frontend sends Local API RPC requests to the returned URL.

If startup sees an existing `agent.lock` / `agent.port`, the desktop shell probes the recorded port with `agent.status` before reusing it. If the port is stale, the shell removes the runtime files and starts a fresh embedded agent.

Data path on macOS:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/Timeskein/
```

Important files:

```text
timeskein.db
agent.port
agent.lock
```

Browser mode does not use this embedded agent. It keeps using the mock server at `127.0.0.1:3456`.

## Verified Checks

The current local baseline has been verified with:

```bash
CI=true pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter @timeskein/contracts build
pnpm --filter @timeskein/desktop build:frontend
pnpm typecheck
cargo check -p timeskein-agent
cargo check -p timeskein-desktop
pnpm smoke:focus-api
pnpm smoke:mock-api
pnpm --filter @timeskein/desktop build
pnpm smoke:macos-app
pnpm smoke:export-focus-day
pnpm smoke:dogfood-report
pnpm smoke:dogfood-finish
pnpm smoke:dogfood-status
pnpm smoke:dogfood-ready
pnpm smoke:dogfood-reset-db
pnpm smoke:dogfood-start
pnpm smoke:dogfood-stop-active
pnpm smoke:open-macos-app
pnpm dogfood:preflight
```

Runtime smoke on macOS:

- `Timeskein.app` starts
- embedded agent creates `agent.port`
- `agent.status` returns `db_ok: true`
- `inventory.list` returns an empty list against the real SQLite-backed agent
- `focus.start`, `focus.stop`, `focus.list`, and Work Item focus switching work against the real SQLite-backed agent
- `pnpm smoke:macos-app` launches the packaged `.app` binary with a temporary home directory and verifies embedded-agent `agent.status`, `inventory.list`, focus start/stop/list, title reuse, focus switching, active Work Item deletion, and active focus restoration after app restart
- `pnpm smoke:macos-app` also verifies startup normalization of legacy active Work Items, orphan active focus sessions, and stale `agent.lock` / `agent.port` recovery
- `pnpm smoke:export-focus-day` verifies fallback Markdown export against a temporary SQLite database
- `pnpm smoke:dogfood-report` verifies the evening dogfood report wrapper and analysis prompts
- `pnpm smoke:dogfood-finish` verifies the end-of-day gate: no active focus session, no active Work Item, and at least one focus block
- `pnpm smoke:dogfood-status` verifies the embedded-agent status checker against healthy and unhealthy temporary HTTP agents
- `pnpm smoke:dogfood-ready` verifies the real-database readiness checker against clean and contaminated temporary SQLite databases, including running-process visibility and the actionable next commands
- `pnpm smoke:dogfood-reset-db` verifies dry-run, backup-reset behavior, and running-process refusal on temporary database files
- `pnpm smoke:dogfood-start` verifies the start gate against clean and contaminated temporary SQLite databases, including clean-start reset, without opening the app
- `pnpm smoke:dogfood-stop-active` verifies dry-run, direct SQLite fallback, running-process refusal, and running-agent API behavior for closing a stuck active focus block
- `pnpm smoke:open-macos-app` verifies that the macOS opener, `--check-only`, and `--check-running-only` refuse to reuse an already running `timeskein-desktop` process

Dogfood launch helper:

- `pnpm dogfood:start` checks the real local database and running-process guard first, then runs preflight, opens the macOS app when all gates pass, and waits for the embedded agent to respond
- `pnpm dogfood:start:clean` moves the current local SQLite files aside through the same guarded reset path, then runs the normal dogfood start gate; `pnpm dogfood:start:clean:preview` prints the reset plan and checks non-mutating gates
- `pnpm dogfood:status` waits for the local embedded-agent port file and verifies `agent.status`
- `pnpm dogfood:finish` checks that the day can be closed with no active focus session or active Work Item, then prints the Markdown dogfood report
- `pnpm dogfood:finish:save` runs the same end-of-day gate and saves the Markdown report to `timeskein-dogfood-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `pnpm dogfood:preflight` runs the local checks needed before trusting a real dogfood day, including isolated mock API, export, and dogfood-report smoke checks
- `pnpm dogfood:ready` inspects the real local SQLite database for active sessions, active Work Items, duplicate titles, existing focus blocks for today, agent responsiveness, and running app processes; when the day is not ready it prints exact stop/reset commands
- `pnpm dogfood:reset-db` moves the real local SQLite database and sidecar files aside only when `--apply` is passed; it refuses while the agent or app process appears alive unless `--force` is passed
- `pnpm dogfood:stop-active` stops active focus sessions, writes a stop note, and clears active Work Items only when `--apply` is passed; it uses the running agent API when available and direct SQLite only when neither agent nor app process is alive, unless `--force` is passed
- `pnpm dogfood:macos` rebuilds and opens the packaged app for a real Session replacement day
- `pnpm open:macos-app` refuses by default when `timeskein-desktop` is already running, so a dogfood start does not silently activate an old process; `--check-only` validates bundle plus guard without opening the app, and `--check-running-only` runs only the process guard before preflight has built the app
- `pnpm export:focus-day` prints a Markdown day report from the local SQLite database as a fallback to UI copy
- `pnpm dogfood:report` prints a Markdown dogfood report with focus data and evening review prompts, marked as a draft if a focus block or Work Item is still active

Runtime smoke in browser/mock mode:

- mock server starts on localhost
- `focus.start`, `focus.stop`, `focus.list`, and Work Item focus switching work against the mock API
- `pnpm smoke:focus-api` verifies the same flow and refuses to run over an existing active focus session
- `pnpm smoke:mock-api` starts an isolated mock server, runs `smoke:focus-api`, and stops it
- manual browser UI smoke was checked on 2026-06-30: start by typed title, switch by typed title, stop with note, Today list, totals, and `Copy Report` Markdown with both Work Items

## Implemented Features

- Focus Session panel
- Start focus from text by finding or creating a Work Item with that title
- Create Work Item also reuses an existing normalized title instead of creating a duplicate
- Create dialog defaults new Work Items to `unknown`; choosing `active` is an explicit focus-start action
- Start focus session from the selected Work Item
- Press `Space` with an empty focus input to start or switch to the selected Work Item
- Double-click a Work Item to start or switch focus to it
- Stop the active focus block by pressing `Enter` in the stop-note field or by clicking `Stop`
- Switch directly to another focus title from the active focus panel
- Set a Work Item to `active` to switch focus to it
- Move the active Work Item to another state to stop the linked focus block
- Delete the active Work Item to stop the linked focus block before the item is removed
- Reuse an existing Work Item when the typed title matches an existing title
- At most one active Work Item is kept in sync with the active focus session
- 25-minute target with elapsed contact time and overflow display
- Manual stop with optional note
- Active focus session restored from SQLite after frontend/app restart
- Today's focus blocks with total active time, entrance count, stop notes, and significant gap ranges of 20+ minutes
- Day views include focus blocks that overlap the selected local day; duration totals are clipped to the selected day window
- Today and Markdown export show an `Open Gap` when no focus block is running and the interval after the last stopped block is at least 20 minutes
- Today's focus picture can be copied as Markdown from the focus panel, including per-Work-Item totals and significant gaps
- Today's focus picture can also be exported from SQLite with `pnpm export:focus-day`
- Evening dogfood report can be copied from the focus panel, shown as selected Markdown if clipboard access fails, or generated with `pnpm dogfood:report`
- The UI and CLI label the report as a draft while a focus block or Work Item is still active and include an active-state warning in the Markdown
- Manual Work Item inventory UI
- Search
- Create Work Item
- Touch
- State changes
- Notes
- Pin/unpin
- Refs UI and Local API methods
- Delete with confirmation
- Global shortcut registration with fallback candidates
- Tray/menu bar entry point on macOS with Show/Hide and Quit actions
- Tray/menu bar title shows a short active focus counter such as `12m Focus`
- Borderless window can be moved by dragging the header
- `Esc` hides the macOS window when no dialog is open
- Destructive confirmation dialogs focus `Cancel` by default and do not confirm on `Enter`
- Focus input is refocused when the window becomes visible and no block is active
- SQLite storage through the embedded Rust agent
- Mock server for browser development

## Focus Session Data

The first Focus Session baseline is intentionally small. It stores manual contact-time blocks:

- title copied from the linked Work Item
- Work Item link
- state: `active` or `stopped`
- target seconds, currently 25 minutes by default in the UI
- start time, stop time, updated time
- optional stop note

The Rust agent stores focus sessions in SQLite. Partial unique indexes enforce at most one active focus session and at most one active Work Item. Work Item `active` is treated as the UI marker for the currently timed item: switching it stops the old focus block and starts a new linked block, while stopping a linked focus block clears `active` from Work Items. On startup, the agent normalizes old active Work Item rows and stops an active focus session if its linked Work Item is missing or deleted. Starting focus from typed text first searches for an existing Work Item with the same normalized title; if none exists, it creates one. The mock server exposes the same `focus.current`, `focus.start`, `focus.stop`, and `focus.list` RPC methods for browser development.

## Global Shortcut and Tray

The desktop app tries these global shortcut candidates:

1. `Ctrl+Shift+Space`
2. `Ctrl+Option+Space`
3. `Cmd+Option+Space`

If macOS rejects all candidates, the app still starts and remains available through the menu bar/tray item.

On multi-monitor macOS setups, the tray/status item is controlled by the system menu bar behavior. Timeskein creates one status item; macOS decides on which menu bar it appears.

## Known Limitations

- Windows packaging is deferred.
- Android is not implemented.
- macOS build currently produces `.app` only; DMG packaging is deferred.
- Browser mode uses mock data only.
- Focus Session does not implement pause, resume, or cancel yet.
- Focus Session has a compact day list and Markdown copy, but not a full reporting/JSON/CSV export view yet.
- Automated e2e tests are not implemented yet.
- Cross-platform CI is not implemented yet.
- Settings UI is not implemented yet.
- Agent lifecycle is minimal: embedded startup works, but production-grade diagnostics/restart handling are not done.
- Sync, SourceNodes, Context Capture, and Evidence-Mode are future levels, not current functionality.

## Next Engineering Steps

1. Dogfood one real working day through Focus Session using [Dogfood Day Protocol](dogfood-day.md).
2. Add smoke/e2e tests for browser mock mode and macOS embedded-agent mode.
3. Decide whether pause/resume/cancel are needed before regular use.
4. Improve day review beyond the dogfood report if the first real day shows gaps in the analysis flow.
5. Consider adding an automated browser UI smoke if the manual dogfood path keeps changing.
6. Improve agent lifecycle diagnostics and user-visible error states.
